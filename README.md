Imported ```react-chessboard``` from https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard to visualize the board. Together with the previously imported ```chess.js```, the website now supports:
* Beautifully displayed chess board, with elegant moving animations and graceful looking pieces and board.
* Choose to play against human (yourself) or computer (random response) with a form. After pressing the "Set" button, the board will automatically reset.
